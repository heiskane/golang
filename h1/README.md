# CryptV1

What crypt.go does is encrypt a given string with the provided key. I think the way it works makes it technically Vigen√®re cipher.
Example usage seen in the image. PS. This is obviously not secure in any way.

To actually build this run: ```go build crypt.go```
Note that a better version is available here https://github.com/heiskane/golang/tree/master/h2
