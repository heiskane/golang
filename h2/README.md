# CryptV2

```
I was granted permission byt the teacher to improve my previous script in following way for this 
homework: Separate code into functions, Implement reading Files and Handle Errors. What it does 
now is it takes a file then reads its contents and encrypts them with a file.
Example Usage: ./cryptv2 -f path/to/file -k secretKey > encrypted.txt
	       ./cryptv2 -f encypted.txt -k secretKey (Optionally can send to a file again)
```
